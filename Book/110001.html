<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Increase. It furthers one<br>
To undertake something.<br>
It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Wind and thunder: the image of Increase.<br>
Thus the superior man:<br>
If he sees good, he imitates it;<br>
If he has faults, he rids himself of them.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>

<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
It furthers one to accomplish great deeds.<br>
Supreme good fortune. No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Someone does indeed increase him;<br>
Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.<br>
Constant perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
The king presents him before God.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
One is enriched through unfortunate events.<br>
No blame, if you are sincere<br>
And walk in the middle,<br>
And report with a seal to the prince.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
If you walk in the middle<br>
And report to the prince,<br>
He will follow.<br>
It furthers one to be used<br>
In the removal of the capital.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.<br>
Supreme good fortune.<br>
Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He brings increase to no one.<br>
Indeed, someone even strikes him.<br>
He does not keep his heart constantly steady.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>
