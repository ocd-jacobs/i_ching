<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Decrease combined with sincerity<br>
Brings about supreme good fortune<br>
Without blame.<br>
One may be persevering in this.<br>
It furthers one to undertake something.<br>
How is this to be carried out?<br>
One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.<br>

<blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
At the foot of the mountain, the lake:<br>
The image of Decrease.<br>
Thus the superior man controls his anger<br>
And restrains his instincts.<br>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Going quickly when one's tasks are finished<br>
Is without blame.<br>
But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Perseverance furthers.<br>
To undertake something brings misfortune.<br>
Without decreasing oneself,<br>
One is able to bring increase to others.<br>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
When three people journey together,<br>
Their number decreases by one.<br>
When one man journeys alone,<br>
He finds a companion.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
If a man decreases his faults,<br>
It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.<br>
No blame.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Someone does indeed increase him.<br>
Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.<br>
Supreme good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
If one is increased without depriving others,<br>
there is no blame.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
It furthers one to undertake something.<br>
One obtains servants<br>
But no longer has a separate home.<br>
