<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Work on What Has Been Spoiled<br>
Has supreme success.<br>
It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
Before the starting point, three days.<br>
After the starting point, three days.<br>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
The wind blows low on the mountain:<br>
The image of Decay.<br>
Thus the superior man stirs up the people<br>
And strengthens their spirit.<br>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
If there is a son,<br>
No blame rests upon the departed father.<br>
Danger. In the end good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother.<br>
One must not be too persevering.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
There will be little remorse. No great blame.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
In continuing one sees humiliation.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.<br>
One meets with praise.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He does not serve kings and princes,<br>
Sets himself higher goals.<br>
