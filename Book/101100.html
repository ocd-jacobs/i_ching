<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
The Wanderer. Success through smallness.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune<br>
To the wanderer.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Fire on the mountain:<br>
The image of The Wanderer.<br>
Thus the superior man<br>
Is clear-minded and cautious<br>
In imposing penalties,<br>
And protracts no lawsuits.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things,<br>
He draws down misfortune upon himself.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
The wanderer comes to and inn.<br>
He has his property with him.<br>
He wins the steadfastness of a young servant.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
The wanderer's inn burns down.<br>
He loses the steadfastness of his young servant.<br>
Danger.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
The wanderer rests in a shelter.<br>
He obtains his property and an ax.<br>
My heart is not glad.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
He shoots a pheasant.<br>
It drops with the first arrow.<br>
In the end this brings both praise and office.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
The bird's nest burns up.<br>
The wanderer laughs at first,<br>
Then must needs lament and weep.<br>
Through carelessness he loses his cow.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>
