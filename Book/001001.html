<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Keeping Still. Keeping his back still<br>
So that he no longer feels his body.<br>
He goes into the courtyard<br>
And does not see his people.<br>
No blame.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Mountains standing close together:<br>
The image of Keeping Still.<br>
Thus the superior man<br>
Does not permit his thoughts<br>
To go beyond his situation.<br>

<blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Keeping his toes still.<br>
No blame.<br>
Continued perseverance furthers.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Keeping his calves still.<br>
He cannot rescue him whom he follows.<br>
His heart is not glad.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Keeping his hips still.<br>
Making his sacrum stiff.<br>
Dangerous. The heart suffocates.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Keeping his trunk still.<br>
No blame.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Keeping his jaws still.<br>
The words have order.<br>
Remorse disappears.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
Noblehearted keeping still.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
