<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
The Family. The perseverance of the woman furthers.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Wind comes forth from fire:<br>
The image of The Family.<br>
Thus the superior man has substance in his words<br>
And duration in his way of life.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Firm seclusion within the family.<br>
Remorse disappears.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
She should not follow her whims.<br>
She must attend within to the food.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
When tempers flare up in the family,<br>
Too great severity brings remorse.<br>
Good fortune nonetheless.<br>
When woman and child dally and laugh,<br>
It leads in the end to humiliation.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
She is the treasure of the house.<br>
Great good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
As a king he approaches his family.<br>
Fear not.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
His work commands respect.<br>
In the end good fortune comes.<br>
</blockquote>
