<blockquote>
The lower trigram, Sun, represents wood, and the upper, K'un, means the 
earth. Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows upward. In 
contrast to the meaning of Chin, PROGRESS (35) pushing upward is 
associated with effort, just as a plant needs energy for pushing upward 
through the earth. That is why this hexagram, although it is connected with 
success, is associated with effort of the will. In PROGRESS the emphasis is on 
expansion; PUSHING UPWARD indicates rather a vertical ascent-direct rise 
from obscurity and lowliness to power and influence.
</blockquote>

<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.<br>
One must see the great man.<br>
Fear not.<br>
Departure toward the south<br>
Brings good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>
The pushing upward of the good elements encounters no obstruction and is 
therefore accompanied by great success. The pushing upward is made 
possible not by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the individual 
is borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he advances.  He must go to 
see authoritative people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success is 
assured. But he must set to work, for activity (this is the meaning of "the 
south") brings good fortune.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Within the earth, wood grows:<br>
The image of PUSHING UPWARD.<br>
Thus the superior man of devoted character<br>
Heaps up small things<br>
In order to achieve something high and great.<br>

<blockquote>
Adapting itself to obstacles and bending around them, wood in the earth 
grows upward without haste and without rest. Thus too the superior man is 
devoted in character and never pauses in his progress.

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="../images/square.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="[]" 
BORDER="0"> <b>Six at the beginning means:</b><br>
Pushing upward that meets with confidence<br>
Brings great good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>
This situation at the beginning of ascent. Just as wood draws strength for its 
upward push from the root, which in itself is in the lowest place, so the 
power to rise comes from this low and obscure station. But there is a spiritual 
affinity with the rulers above, and this solidarity creates the confidence 
needed to accomplish something.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine in the second place means:</b><br>
If one is sincere,<br>
It furthers one to bring even a small offering.<br>
No blame.<br>

<blockquote>
Here a strong man is presupposed. It is true that he does not fit in with his 
environment, inasmuch as he is too brusque and pays too little attention to 
form. But as he is upright in character, he meets with response, and his lack 
of outward form does no harm. Here uprightness is the outcome of sound 
qualities of character, whereas in the corresponding line of the preceding 
hexagram it is the result of innate humility.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine in the third place means:</b><br>
One pushes upward into an empty city.<br>

<blockquote>
All obstructions that generally block progress fall away here. Things proceed 
with remarkable ease. Unhesitatingly one follows this road, in order to profit 
by one's success. Seen from without, everything seems to be in the best of 
order. However, no promise of good fortune is added.  It is a question how 
long such unobstructed success can last. But it is wise not to yield to such 
misgivings, because they only inhibit one's power. Instead, the point is to 
profit by the propitiousness of time.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Six in the fourth place means:</b><br>
The king offers him Mount Ch'i.<br>
Good fortune. No blame.<br>

<blockquote>
Mount Ch'i is in the western China, the homeland of King Wên, whose son, 
the Duke of Chou, added the words to the individual lines. The 
pronouncement takes us back to a time when the Chou dynasty was coming 
into power. At that time King Wên introduced his illustrious helpers to the 
god of his native mountain, and they received their places in the halls of the 
ancestors by the side of the ruler. This indicates a stage in which pushing 
upward attains its goal. One acquires fame in the sight of gods and men, is 
received into the circle of those who foster the spiritual life of the nation, and 
thereby attains a significance that endures beyond time.

<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="../images/circle.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="[]" 
BORDER="0"> <b>Six in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
One pushes upward by steps.<br>

<blockquote>
When a man is advancing farther and farther, it is important for him not to 
become intoxicated by success. Precisely when he experiences great success it 
is necessary to remain sober and not to try to skip any stages; he must go on 
slowly, step by step, as though hesitant. Only such calm, steady progress, 
overleaping nothing, leads to the goal.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Six at the top means:</b><br>
Pushing upward in darkness.<br>
It furthers one<br>
to be unremittingly persevering.<br>

<blockquote>
He who pushes upward blindly deludes himself. He knows only advance, 
not retreat. But this means exhaustion. In such a case it is important to be 
constantly mindful that one must be conscientious and consistent and must 
remain so. Only thus does one become free of blind impulse, which is always 
harmful.
