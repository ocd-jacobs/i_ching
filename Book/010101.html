<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
After Completion. Success in small matters.<br>
Perseverance furthers.<br>
At the beginning good fortune,<br>
At the end disorder.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Water over fire: the image of the condition<br>
In After Completion.<br>
Thus the superior man<br>
Takes thoughts of misfortune<br>
And arms himself against it in advance.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
He brakes his wheels.<br>
He gets his tail in the water.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
The woman loses the curtain of her carriage.<br>
Do not run after it;<br>
On the seventh day you will get it.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
The Illustrious Ancestor<br>
Disciplines the Devil's Country.<br>
After three years he conquers it.<br>
Inferior people must not be employed.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
The finest clothes turn to rags.<br>
Be careful all day long.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox<br>
Does not attain as much real happiness<br>
As the neighbor in the west<br>
With his small offering.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He gets his head in the water. Danger.<br>
</blockquote>
