<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
The Corners of the Mouth.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
Pay heed to the providing of nourishment.<br>
And to what a man seeks<br>
To fill his own mouth with.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
At the foot of the mountain, thunder:<br>
The image of Providing Nourishment.<br>
Thus the superior man is careful of his words<br>
And temperate in eating and drinking.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
You let your magic tortoise go,<br>
And look at me with the corners of your mouth drooping.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Turning to the summit for nourishment,<br>
Deviating from the path<br>
To seek nourishment from the hill.<br>
Continuing to do this brings misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Turning away from nourishment.<br>
Perseverance brings misfortune.<br>
Do not act thus for ten years.<br>
Nothing serves to further.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Turning to the summit<br>
For provision of nourishment<br>
Brings good fortune.<br>
Spying about with sharp eyes<br>
Like a tiger with insatiable craving.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Turning away from the path.<br>
To remain persevering brings good fortune.<br>
One should not cross the great water.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
The source of nourishment.<br>
Awareness of danger brings good fortune.<br>
It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
</blockquote>
