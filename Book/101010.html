<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Before Completion. Success.<br>
But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,<br>
Gets his tail in the water,<br>
There is nothing that would further.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Fire over water:<br>
The image of the condition before transition.<br>
Thus the superior man is careful<br>
In the differentiation of things,<br>
So that each finds its place.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
He gets his tail in the water.<br>
Humiliating.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
He brakes his wheels.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Before completion, attack brings misfortune.<br>
It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
Remorse disappears.<br>
Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country.<br>
For three years, great realms are awarded.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
No remorse.<br>
The light of the superior man is true.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
There is drinking of wine<br>
In genuine confidence. No blame.<br>
But if one wets his head,<br>
He loses it, in truth.<br>
</blockquote>
