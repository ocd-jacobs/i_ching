<blockquote>
This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above, 
drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the 
depths. The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time of standstill and 
decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month (August-
September), when the year has passed its zenith and autumnal decay is setting 
in. 
</blockquote>

<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
STANDSTILL. Evil people do not further<br>
The perseverance of the superior man.<br>
The great departs; the small approaches.<br>

<blockquote>
Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What 
is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and 
disorder prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. 
Weakness is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and 
without are the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of 
superior people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow 
themselves to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting 
influence is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their 
principles and withdraw into seclusion.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Heaven and earth do not unite:<br>
The image of STANDSTILL.<br>
Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth<br>
In order to escape the difficulties.<br>
He does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.<br>

<blockquote>
When, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails in 
public life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the fundaments 
are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under such 
circumstances; he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers to 
take part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger, since he 
cannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides his worth 
and withdraws into seclusion.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Six at the beginning means:</b><br>
When the ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.<br>
Each according to his kind.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune and success.<br>

<blockquote>
The text is almost the same as that of the first line of the preceding hexagram, 
but with a contrary meaning. In the latter a man is drawing another along 
with him on the road to an official career; here a man is drawing another 
with him into retirement form public life. This is why the text says here, 
"Perseverance brings good fortune and success," and not "Undertakings bring 
good fortune." If it becomes impossible to make our influence count, it is 
only by retirement that we spare ourselves humiliation. Success in a higher 
sense can be ours, because we know how to safeguard the value of our 
personalities.

BORDER="0"> <b>Six in the second place means:</b><br>
They bear and endure;<br>
This means good fortune for inferior people.<br>
The standstill serves to help the great man attain success.<br>

<blockquote>
Inferior people are ready to flatter their superiors in a servile way. They 
would also endure the superior man if he would put an end to their 
confusion. This is fortunate for them. But the great man calmly bears the 
consequences of the standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd of the 
inferior; that is not his place. By his willingness to suffer personally he 
insures the success of his fundamental principles.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Six in the third place means:</b><br>
They bear shame.<br>

<blockquote>
Inferior people who have risen to power illegitimately do not feel equal to the 
responsibility they have taken upon themselves. In their hearts they begin to 
be ashamed, although at first they do not show it outwardly. This marks a 
turn for the better. 
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine in the fourth place means:</b><br>
He who acts at the command of the highest<br>
Remains without blame.<br>
Those of like mind partake of the blessing.<br>

<blockquote>
The time of standstill is nearing the point of change into its opposite. 
Whoever wishes to restore order must feel himself called to the task and 
have the necessary authority. A man who sets himself up a capable of 
creating order according to his own judgment could make mistakes and end 
in failure. But the man who is truly called to the task is favored by the 
conditions of the time, and all those of like mind will share in his blessing.

<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="../images/circle.gif" WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=12 ALT="[]" 
BORDER="0"> <b>Nine in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Standstill is giving way.<br>
Good fortune for the great man.<br>
"What if it should fail, what if it should fail?"<br>
In this way, he ties it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.<br>

<blockquote>
The time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order, has 
arrived. Hence "good fortune." But such periods of transition are the very 
times in which we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only through 
greatest caution, which asks always, "What if it should fail?" When a 
mulberry bush is cut down, a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from 
the roots. Hence the image of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots 
is used to symbolize the way of making success certain. Confucius says about 
this line:<br>
<br>
"Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatens 
when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a 
man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget 
danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion 
when his affairs are in order. In this way he gains personal safety and is able 
to protect the empire."
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine at the top means:</b><br>
The standstill comes to an end.<br>
First standstill, then good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>
The standstill does not last forever. However, it does not cease of its own 
accord; the right man is needed to end it. This is the difference between a 
state of peace and a state of stagnation. Continuous effort is necessary to 
maintain peace: left to itself it would change into stagnation and 
disintegration. The time of disintegration, however, does not change back 
automatically to a condition of peace and prosperity; effort must be put forth 
in order to end it. This shows the creative attitude that man must take if the 
world is to be put in order.
