<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Preponderance of the Small. Success.<br>
Perseverance furthers.<br>
Small things may be done; great things should not be done.<br>
The flying bird brings the message:<br>
It is not well to strive upward,<br>
It is well to remain below.<br>
Great good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Thunder on the mountain:<br>
The image of Preponderance of the Small.<br>
Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.<br>
In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.<br>
In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.<br>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
The bird meets with misfortune through flying.<br>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
She passes by her ancestor<br>
And meets her ancestress.<br>
He does not reach his prince<br>
And meets the official.<br>
No blame.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
If one is not extremely careful,<br>
Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.<br>
Misfortune.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
No blame. He meets him without passing by.<br>
Going brings danger. One must be on guard.<br>
Do not act. Be constantly persevering.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Dense clouds,<br>
No rain from our western territory.<br>
The prince shoots and hits him who is in the cave.<br>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He passes him by, not meeting him.<br>
The flying bird leaves him.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
This means bad luck and injury.<br>
