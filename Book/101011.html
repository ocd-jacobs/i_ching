<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Opposition. In small matters, good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Above fire; below, the lake:<br>
The image of Opposition.<br>
Thus amid all fellowship<br>
The superior man retains his individuality.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
Remorse disappears.<br>
If you lose your horse, do not run after it;<br>
It will come back of its own accord.<br>
When you see evil people,<br>
Guard yourself against mistakes.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
One meets his lord in a narrow street.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
One sees the wagon dragged back,<br>
The oxen halted,<br>
A man's hair and nose cut off.<br>
Not a good beginning, but a good end.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Isolated through opposition,<br>
One meets a like-minded man<br>
With whom one can associate in good faith.<br>
Despite the danger, no blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Remorse disappears.<br>
The companion bites his way through the wrappings.<br>
If one goes to him,<br>
How could it be a mistake?<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
Isolated through opposition,<br>
One sees one's companion as a pig covered with dirt,<br>
As a wagon full of devils.<br>
First one draws a bow against him,<br>
Then one lays the bow aside.<br>
He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time.<br>
As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.<br>
