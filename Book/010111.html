<blockquote>
The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement; the 
lower trigram, water, in accordance with its nature tends downward. Thus the 
two halves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict.
  The attribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger, guile. 
Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict.
  A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the 
combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A 
person of this character will certainly be quarrelsome.
</blockquote>

<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Conflict. You are sincere<br>
And are being obstructed.<br>
A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.<br>
Going through to the end brings misfortune.<br>
It furthers one to see the great man.<br>
It does not further one to cross the great water.<br>

<blockquote>
Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into 
opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to 
craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.
  If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-
headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by 
meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has 
evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity is then 
perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man 
whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a 
just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that 
is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful 
they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to 
conquer danger without.

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Heaven and water go their opposite ways:<br>
The image of Conflict.<br>
Thus in all his transactions the superior man<br>
Carefully considers the beginning.<br>

<blockquote>
The image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the opposing 
tendencies of the two trig rams. Once these opposing tendencies appear, 
conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be taken 
carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties are 
exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals 
harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Six at the beginning means:</b><br>
If one does not perpetuate the affair,<br>
There is little gossip.<br>
In the end, good fortune comes.<br>

<blockquote>
While a conflict is in the incipient stage, the best thing To do is to drop the 
issue. Especially when the adversary is stronger, it is not advisable to risk 
pushing the conflict to a decision. It may come to a slight dispute, but in the 
end all goes well.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine in the second place means:</b><br>
One cannot engage in conflict;<br>
One returns home, gives way.<br>
The people of his town,<br>
Three hundred households,<br>
Remain free of guilt.<br>

<blockquote>
In a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace. 
Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. If, out of a false sense of 
honor, a man allowed himself to be tempted into an unequal conflict, he 
would be drawing down disaster upon himself. In such a case a wise and 
conciliatory attitude benefits the whole community, which will then not be 
drawn into the conflict.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Six in the third place means:</b><br>
To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.<br>
Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.<br>
If by chance you are in the service of a king,<br>
Seek not works.<br>

<blockquote>
This is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition. Only 
that which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanent 
possession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but since it 
is really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man possesses 
through the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one enters the 
service of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking works for the 
sake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go to the 
other.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine in the fourth place means:</b><br>
One cannot engage in conflict.<br>
One turns back and submits to fate,<br>
Nines one's attitude,<br>
And finds peace in perseverance.<br>
Good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>
This refers to a person whose inner attitude at first lacks peace. He does not 
feel content with his situation and would like to improve it through conflict. 
In contrast tot the situation of the nine in the second place, he is dealing with 
a weaker opponent and might therefore succeed. But he cannot carry on the 
fight, because, since right is not on his side, he cannot justify the conflict to 
his conscience. Therefore he turns back and accepts his fate. He changes his 
mind and finds lasting peace in being at one with eternal law. This brings 
good fortune.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>° Nine in the fifth place means:</b><br>
To contend before him<br>
Brings good fortune.<br>

<blockquote>
This refers to an arbiter in a conflict who is powerful and just, and strong 
enough to lend weight to the right side. A dispute can be turned over to him 
with confidence. If one is in the right, one attains great good fortune.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Nine at the top means:</b><br>
Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,<br>
By the end of morning<br>
It will have been snatched away three times.<br>

<blockquote>
Here we have someone who has carried a conflict to the bitter end and has 
triumphed. He is granted a decoration, but his happiness does not last.  He is 
attacked again and again, and the result is conflict without end.
