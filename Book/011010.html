<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Oppression. Success. Perseverance.<br>
The great man brings about good fortune.<br>
No blame.<br>
When one has something to say,<br>
It is not believed.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
There is no water in the lake:<br>
The image of Exhaustion.<br>
Thus the superior man stakes his life<br>
On following his will.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
One sits oppressed under a bare tree<br>
And strays into a gloomy valley.<br>
For three years one sees nothing.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
One is oppressed while at meat and drink.<br>
The man with the scarlet knee bands is just coming.<br>
It furthers one to offer sacrifice.<br>
To set forth brings misfortune.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone,<br>
And leans on thorns and thistles.<br>
He enters his house and does not see his wife.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage.<br>
Humiliation, but the end is reached.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

 <b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
His nose and feet are cut off.<br>
Oppression at the hands of the man with the purple knee bands.<br>
Joy comes softly.<br>
It furthers one to make offerings and libations.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
He is oppressed by creeping vines.<br>
He moves uncertainly and says, "Movement brings remorse."<br>
If one feels remorse over this and makes a start,<br>
Good fortune comes.<br>
