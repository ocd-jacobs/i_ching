<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Obstruction. The southwest furthers.<br>
The northeast does not further.<br>
It furthers one to see the great man.<br>
Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Water on the mountain:<br>
The image of Obstruction.<br>
Thus the superior man turns his attention to himself<br>
And molds his character.<br>
</blockquote>

But it is not his own fault.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Going leads to obstructions;<br>
Hence he comes back.<br>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
In the midst of the greatest obstructions,<br>
Friends come.<br>
</blockquote>
