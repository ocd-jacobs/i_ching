<h3>The Judgement</h3>

<blockquote>
Biting Through has success.<br>
It is favorable to let justice be administered.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Image</h3>

<blockquote>
Thunder and lightning:<br>
The image of Biting Through.<br>
Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws<br>
Through clearly defined penalties.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Lines</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the beginning means:</b><br>
His feet are fastened in the stocks,<br>
So that his toes disappear.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the second place means:</b><br>
Bites through tender meat,<br>
So that his nose disappears.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the third place means:</b><br>
Bites on old dried meat<br>
And strikes on something poisonous.<br>
Slight humiliation. No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change in the fourth place means:</b><br>
Bites on dried gristly meat.<br>
Receives metal arrows.<br>
It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties<br>
And to be persevering.<br>
Good fortune.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<b>Change in the fifth place means:</b><br>
Bites on dried lean meat.<br>
Receives yellow gold.<br>
Perseveringly aware of danger.<br>
No blame.<br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<b>Change at the top means:</b><br>
His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,<br>
So that his ears disappear.<br>
Misfortune.<br>
</blockquote>
